# ðŸš” Police Stop Data â€“ Basic Analysis
  This project is a simple analysis of police stop data from Kaggle. I wanted to understand patterns in traffic stopsâ€”such as when they happen most often, how driver gender and race are distributed, and what the most common outcomes are.

   To start, I cleaned the dataset by filling in missing values, combining the date and time columns into one datetime column, and dropping a few that werenâ€™t needed for the analysis. After that, I explored the number of stops by hour, calculated gender distribution percentages, and looked at how often drivers were given citations or arrested. I also compared arrest rates based on race and gender to see if there were any noticeable differences.

   The project was built using Python, mostly with pandas for data handling and matplotlib for basic visualizations.
